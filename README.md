The goal of this script is used to analyze the membrane simulation w/o co-sovlent.

Run this command to install the python packages.

```shell

bash package_install.sh
```

After finishing install all the required packages, you are good to run the analysis script.

```shell
bash density_run_script.sh
```

This script is required to input the following information.
_ Density profile path
_
